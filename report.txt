IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS FOR MYSHELL
BY: GIORGIO TATARELLI

MyShell is a program that replicates the linux shell interface and several key functions it has. It comes with various built in
functions (cd, clr, dir, etc.), and can use execvp to call any external functions available in linux. Some of it's key features are 
the bash command operators that allow various advanced actions like redirection and background execution. 
Their implementation is described later.

DESIGN OVERVIEW

main(int argc, char**argv, char **envp) | myShell.c
Before executing anything, the user can make a choice whether they want to launch MyShell in interactive mode or in batch mode by calling
MyShell with a bash file name. In interactive mode, the use can input commands one line at a time into the interface provided, similar to 
a regular shell. In batch mode, MyShell parses each line of the batch file and runs them. With the way my implementation works, it doesn't
matter where the command comes from, the program treats it the same regardless. 

parse(char *line, char **envp, char abs[]) | parse.c
Once in the parser, the command line is tokenized and each token is ran through a for loop that stores up to two commands in their own 
string arrays (important later). Outside of this loop is a loop to check each argument for one of the special command operators
>,<,>>,|, or & and to execute the commands according to the operator's function. 

"<,>,>>"
If a redirection operator is found, the program assumes the argument immediately after the operator is a file name. From there, it 
redirects stdin (<) or stdout (> to overwrite contents, >> to append) to that file. After checking the whole line, the program
runs the desired command and restores any input streams that were redirected.

"|"
If a pipe operator is found, the program  creates a pipe, takes the function to the left of pipe, forks, and redirects stdout to the write 
end of the pipeso the first command's output can go to the second command by forking again and changing stdin to the read end of the pipe, 
thus making the output of the first the input of the second.

"&"
If an amperand is found, the program simply forks and executes the command immediately before the operator so that it can run without
parallel to the shell. 

builtIns(char **cmd, int length, char** envp, char abs[]) | builtins.c
This function takes a single command, number of arguments, environment variables, and the absolute file path of the shell and returns 1 
if the command matches one of built in commands, and runs that command, and 0 otherwise. 

cd - if the given command is passed with a directory name as an argument, the program uses chdir to change its working directory to that. 
Otherwise, prints the current working directory

clr - prints "\033[H\033[2J" which clears the screen

dir - if the given command is passed with a directory name as an argument, the program opens that directory and prints it's contents. 
Otherwise it just opens and prints the contents of the current working directory

environ - This function loops through and prints each variable in envp

echo - loops through each argument after the word echo and prints them seperated by one space regardless of original spacing

help - uses the abbsolute file path of the shell program to access and read readme_doc in order and prints it

pause - uses fgetc and a while loop to stop the program until the user enters \n

quit/exit - exit the program


runExternal(char **cmd, int len) | parse.c
Run external takes a single command and it's length. It then forks, NULL terminates the command array, and calls execvp on the command name 
and arguments to execute the command. 

TESTING PLAN
Testing occurred throughout the development of the shell, and made EXTENSIVE use of gdb. Specifically, I made extensive use of gdb's 
"backtrace" feature that tells you exacly where the error occurred even it it's a segfault. Whenever a new function was added, I'd run 
it in interactive mode to make sure the program at least didn't segfault (as it did many times). Then at the end, I created a batch file 
with the commands shown in the Week 9 lecture slides and ran it until it could run to completion. Throughout all of this, I am also checking
for correctness i.e. making sure > overwrites and >> appends. Then it was time to check for errors, where I would do things like
entering special characters at the beginning/end of lines and redirecting in from files that don't exist to make sure my error checking
was robust. Upon running my code on an invalid line that involved simultaneous piping and redirection, however, I realized my program was 
still partially running the line before throwing the error. Because of this, I added several error checks BEFORE I run any of the commands
to make sure the command characters aren't in the wrong places. I also added some variables to track things like redirection in, out, number
of ampersands, piping, etc in order for the program to have a better idea of what it was doing before it actually ran. This also fixed another
problem I had in testing which was that my program couldn't correctly do redirection in and out at the same time (i.e. cmd < file1 > file2). By 
keeping track of what was being redirected where before the commands ran, the input and output were redirected BEFORE the commands ran. I also
realized in testing that I could not chain & operators, so I added a variable to account for multiple background processes.

CONCLUSION
Overall I was able to make MyShell as comprehensive as I could. The only feature I couldn't figure out how to implement was chaining
more than 2 & operators (cmd1 & cmd2 & cmd3) because MyShell only supports up to 2 commands for any given operator. This also means I could
not get multiple pipes working as well. I also could not figure out how to pipe and redirect in the same line. But aside from these things, and 
maybe some error cases I haven't thought about, this program should be good to go.

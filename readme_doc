OPERATOR'S MANUAL: MYSHELL
BY: GIORGIO TATARELLI

BUILT IN COMMANDS
MyShell comes with 8 built in commands:

cd - Prints current directory. Call this function with a valid directory name as an argument
and it will change the current working directory to the one specified.

clr - Call to clear the screen.

dir - Prints contents of current directory. Call this function with a valid directory name as 
an argument and it will print the contents of that directory. 

environ - Call to print environment variables.

echo - When called, each word following the command will be printed as a space separated
line regardless of oringinal spacing.

help - Prints this document.

pause - Pauses shell until user inputs enter.

quit/exit - Exits the program.

BASH COMMANDS

Redirection: "<,>,>>"
The redirection command operators must follow a command  and will redirect either stdin (<) or 
stdout (>,>>) to the file name immediately following the operator. This means that in the 
case of <, the contents of that file will be treated as the input for the specified
command. Similarly, > and >> will print the output of the function into a file, where
each operator creates a new file if it doesn't exist and if it does exist then > will overwrite
the file's contents and >> will append to it.

Piping: "|"
The pipe operator takes one command on each side and makes the output of the first the input 
of the second. Specifically, it makes a structure called a pipe that redirects the output of 
the first function to the "write end" of the pipe and redirects the input of the second to 
the "read end."

Background Execution: "&"
The ampersand operator will allow the user to run a command parallel to the shell itself,
essentially making it so the shell can take a new command immediately without waiting
for a command to complete. It does this by forking and executing the command immediately
before the operator.
